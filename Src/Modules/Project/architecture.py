    Abstracts the logic to create a set of layers comprised of convolution, activation, batch normalisation and pooling.
    Params:
        in_channels: An integer passed to torch.nn.Conv2d. Number of input channels to the convolution layer.
        out_channels: An integer passed to torch.nn.Conv2d and nn.NatchNorm2d. Number of output channels to the convolution layer and Number of features to the Batch Normalisation layer.
        kernel_size: An interger passed to torch.nn.Conv2d. Size of the kernel (filter). The size of the kernel is kernel_size x kernel_size.
        stride: An integer passed to torch.nn.Conv2d. Size of the stride for the kernel.
        pool_size: An integer passed to torch.nn.MaxPool2d. Kernel size for the Max Pool 2D layer. The size of the kernel is pool_size x pool_size

    Returns:
        A torch.nn.Module comprised of the aforementioned set of layers
